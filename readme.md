### Workflow Overview
We follow a **feature-branch workflow** to ensure smooth collaboration:

1. **Fork the repository**:
   - If you are not a team member, fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-standup-1.git
    ```

3. **Create a new branch**:
    - Name your branch clearly, based on the feature or bug you are working on.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

4. **Make your changes**:
    - Implement your feature or fix the bug. Ensure that your changes do not break any functionality.
    - Follow best coding practices, and document your code where necessary.

5. **Commit your changes**:
    - Write meaningful commit messages that explain the changes made.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add feature description"
    ```

6. **Push your changes to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

7. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:
    - Once your changes are ready and tested, open a pull request against the `main` branch of the repository.
    - Make sure to explain the purpose of the changes in the PR description.
    
8. **Code Review**:
    - Your PR will be reviewed by another team member. If required, make changes based on the feedback.
    - Once approved, the PR will be merged into the `main` branch.

9. **Delete the feature branch**:
    - After the PR is merged, you can safely delete your feature branch:
    ```bash
    git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
    ```

### Contribution Guidelines
- **Consistency**: Stick to the project's coding style and naming conventions.
- **Commit Frequency**: Make small, frequent commits rather than large, complex ones.
- **Testing**: Ensure all your changes are well-tested before submitting a pull request.
- **Collaboration**: Keep the team updated on your progress and any challenges you face.

### Git Branch Naming Conventions
- **feature/your-feature-name**: For new features.
- **bugfix/issue-description**: For fixing bugs.
- **hotfix/critical-bug-description**: For urgent fixes.
- **doc/update-readme**: For documentation updates.

### Reporting Issues
If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue in this repository. Please include detailed information about the problem, steps to reproduce it, and any error messages encountered.

## Project Schedule
Here is a tentative project schedule for our weekly progress:

- **Week 8**: Project planning and setup (GitHub, Communication channels, Shared documents).
- **Week 9**: Initial data exploration and project design.
- **Week 10**: Development of data visualizations and working on report drafts.
- **Week 11**: Implementation of key features and continued testing.
- **Week 12**: Finalizing code, documentation, and preparing for submission.

## Communication
We are using [Slack/Microsoft Teams/Zalo] as our primary communication tool for real-time collaboration. We have also set up regular weekly meetings on [Insert Day/Time] to discuss progress.

## Issues with Teamwork
There are no major teamwork issues at this time. Any concerns are discussed during regular team meetings.
